# CodePlayer

This is a live code player. Windows for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be toggled. The output of any code written in the respective windows is reflected live in the output window with formatting. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be integrated on the same piece of code in any permutation. 
Great for trying out features before implementing them on larger projects. Instant results save time and effort and allow users to experiment in a mock environment before writing code on bigger files. Programs are sure to be less prone to error if tested here before hand.
